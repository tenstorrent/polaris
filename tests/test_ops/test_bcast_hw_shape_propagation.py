"""``hw_shape`` propagation across an elementwise binary — opt-in, device-scoped.

``hw_shape`` is the NHWC-flattened ``[1, 1, N*H*W, C]`` view that LUT keys and
profiler comparison are built from.  Every data-movement sinf carries it across
— Move, Reshard, InterleavedToSharded, ShardedToInterleaved (``ttsim_layout.py``
:434, :458, :482, :673).  ``bidir_bcast`` did not, so ResNet-50's residual
``Add`` dropped the flattened form and every op downstream keyed on logical NCHW
``(16, 1024, 14, 14)`` where the capture records ``(1, 1, 3136, 1024)``: one
missing line, roughly 27 mis-keyed rows.

Nothing here changes a tensor's ``.shape``, so a regression is silent — it moves
LUT keys and shows up as a hit-rate drop, not a failure.  Hence these tests.

The gate is OFF by default and scoped to a ``Device``
(``TTSIM_PROPAGATE_BCAST_HW_SHAPE``, ``device.py:117``) because it changes the
key of every elementwise binary in every workload, and polaris builds all
workload graphs in one process — a process-wide flag would silently alter
whichever workload happened to be built next.
