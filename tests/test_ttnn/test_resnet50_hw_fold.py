"""conv1's fold is emitted as the seven ops silicon runs, not one Fold SimOp.

Exercises ``ttsim.front.ttnn.op.fold_transpose_sharded_nchw``, a port of
tt-metal's ``fold_with_transpose_sharded_``
(``ttnn/cpp/ttnn/operations/data_movement/fold/fold.cpp:149``), which dispatches
Pad -> Transpose -> Pad -> Transpose -> view -> Transpose -> view -> Transpose
-> Slice.  The two ``ttnn::experimental::view`` calls are free, hence seven
profiler rows.

``ttnn.fold(use_transpose_as_fold=True)`` is a composite on hardware: the p100a
capture records Pad, Transpose, Pad, Transpose, Transpose, Transpose, Slice.
The shim's first-class Fold SimOp collapsed that to one row, so the graph
carried Fold + 2 Reshape against hardware's 7 — a 9-op structural gap and the
whole of the migration skill's A1/A2 failure at this position.

Batch
-----
The shapes are a function of ``(C, H, W, pad_*, stride_*)`` and the batch
dimension ONLY — ``op.py:1406-1451`` never lets N into a trailing dim.  So the
tests run at both batches the BH p100a refruns cover, b16 and b32
(``op.py:1389-1392``), with N templated into position 0 and every other extent
read off the capture unchanged.

This file asserts structure and shape only.

The trailing extents asserted here are READ OFF the capture
(``__refrun_cache/resnet50/bh/p100a/merged_ops_…-260816.csv`` rows 0-6).  They
are measurements, not derivations: if they ever need to change, the new numbers
come from a new capture, not from recomputing them.
