"""``device.num_cores_to_corerangeset`` — the degenerate-grid compatibility shim.

This function is the one place in the port with a *demonstrated* silent-regression
history, which is why it gets its own file.

It began as a stub returning the tuple ``(1, 1)``. Replacing it with a faithful
port of tt-metal's ``num_cores_to_corerangeset``
(``tt_metal/common/work_split.cpp``) broke llama3 at graph-build time: five call
sites in ``workloads/ttnn/tt_transformers*`` reach it with a device whose
``grid_x``/``grid_y`` are still 0, and the faithful implementation asserts on such
a grid. llama3 was not in the 3-workload verification gate at the time, so nothing
caught it. A straight revert then broke ResNet-50, which is a sixth caller and does
need a real CoreRangeSet (it calls ``.num_cores()`` on the result).

The resolution is a split: ``conv_sharding._num_cores_to_corerangeset`` is the
faithful port and asserts on a bad grid; the public ``device`` entry point keeps
the legacy ``(1, 1)`` for a zero or missing grid and delegates otherwise. These
tests pin BOTH halves, because either one alone regresses a real workload.
