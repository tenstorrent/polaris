"""Opt-in shim gates: process-wide defaults plus their per-device overrides.

These gate ttnn-shim behaviours, so their natural home is
``ttsim/front/ttnn/op.py`` — and that is where they lived.  They are here
instead for one reason: ``ttsim.ops`` has to read one of them.

``_propagate_bcast_hw_shape`` is consumed by ``bidir_bcast`` in
``ttsim/ops/desc/helpers.py``, on the shared ONNX path.  With the state in the
front end, that read was a back-edge ``ttsim.ops -> ttsim.front.ttnn``, and
deferring the import into the function body moved it rather than removing it: a
single ``bidir_bcast`` on plain ``SimTensor`` operands pulled the whole ttnn
front end into a pure-ONNX process, and closed a real cycle —

    ttsim.ops.desc.helpers -> ttsim.front.ttnn.op -> ttsim.front.ttnn.tensor
      -> ttsim.front.ttnn.device -> ttsim.graph -> ttsim.graph.wl_graph
      -> ttsim.ops -> ttsim.ops.desc -> ttsim.ops.desc.tensor
      -> ttsim.ops.desc.helpers

which survived only because the deferred import ran after
``ttsim.ops.desc.helpers`` was already initialised.  ``ttsim.utils`` is below
both packages (``ttsim.ops.op`` already imports ``ttsim.utils.common``), so
putting the state here lets each side read it without depending on the other.

Import from HERE, not through the front end.  ``ttsim/front/ttnn/op.py`` pulls
in only the ``<gate>_enabled`` accessors it calls itself; re-exporting the
setters too would leave its import block describing its callers' needs rather
than its own.  Workload infras and gate tests do
``from ttsim.utils.shim_gates import set_<gate>, <gate>_enabled``, which also
keeps a matched pair arriving from one module.

Two layers, resolved in this order by every ``<gate>_enabled``:

    attribute absent on the Device -> the process-wide default here, which is
                                      seeded from ``TTSIM_*`` at import
    attribute present              -> that device's explicit override, set only
                                      by ``set_<gate>(x, device)``

Device.__init__ deliberately does not materialise these onto the instance; see
the note there.  Import this module for the state, never copy a ``_GATE`` value
into another module — ``from ... import _PROPAGATE_MEMORY_CONFIG`` would snapshot
the bool and stop tracking ``set_memory_config_propagation``.
