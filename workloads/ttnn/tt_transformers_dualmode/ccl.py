"""Minimal CCL helpers for the single-chip dual-mode tt_transformers port.

tt-metal's full ccl.py (multi-chip all-gather / reduce-scatter) is intentionally NOT
ported — Polaris is single-chip (num_devices=1; design doc §8c). At num_devices=1 these
collectives are identity passthroughs, matching the shim-only tt_transformers, which
defined them as `return tensor`. Mixtral / multi-chip would need the real CCL; that is
out of scope for this port.
