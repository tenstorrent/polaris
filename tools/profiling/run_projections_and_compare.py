"""Drive polaris projections + compare_layers XLSX comparisons over a fixed (workload × device) matrix.

v1 hardcodes the combo list.  Future iterations: auto-discover from
``config/all_workloads.yaml`` + ``config/tt_{wh,bh}.yaml``.

HW-reference CSVs are not kept in the tree.  Each combo names its reference by the path it occupies
under ``hlm-refrun/`` on LFC, and ``ttsim.utils.lfc.resolve_lfc_path`` fetches it on first use into
``__ext/hlm-refrun/`` -- the same mechanism the arch configs use for ``operator_lookup_file``.  The
cache is re-checked weekly and falls back to the cached copy when LFC is unreachable, except under
``GITHUB_ACTIONS=true``, where ``ttsim.utils.lfc.download_lfc_file`` skips the stale fallback.

Usage::

    python tools/profiling/run_projections_and_compare.py --run-tag my_run

Outputs (under ``__output/<run-tag>/``):
  - ``<combo>/STATS/...-opstats.csv``       (polaris)
  - ``<combo>/STATS/...-opstats.complete``  (written by this tool once polaris has finished)
  - ``<combo>/<combo>_comparison.xlsx``     (compare_layers)
  - ``<combo>/polaris.log``                 (polaris stdout/stderr)
  - ``<combo>/compare.log``                 (compare_layers stdout/stderr)
  - ``summary.md``                          (the aggregated gap / LUT-hit table, also printed)
  - plus whatever else polaris writes under the study directory -- ``clear_stale_outputs`` lists
    what a run leaves today, and empties the directory rather than tracking that list

    combo. A combo can drop out at validation, at polaris, at compare, or at parsing, and in every
    one of those cases it is correctly left out of the summary while a file from a previous run stays
    in the output directory looking current. Clearing next to a producing step only covers failures
    after that step; clearing inside the run loop misses combos that never reach it.

    The logs are cleared here too. ``open('w')`` truncates them, but only for a combo that actually
    reaches a subprocess -- a combo dropped at validation opens neither file, so an earlier run's
    logs would sit beside the new report. Every output named in the module docstring is covered here,
    which is the point: no producing step is trusted to clean up after itself.

    It clears the whole combo directory rather than a list of known outputs, because enumerating
    them kept falling behind what the subprocesses actually write. Beyond the four files named in the
    module docstring, one run also leaves ``CONFIG/<dev>.json``, a ``-opstats.json`` per simulated
