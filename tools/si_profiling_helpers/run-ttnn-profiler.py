TTNN Profiler Runner

This script runs the TTNN profiler with multiple profiling modes using tracy.
It supports basic profiling, NOC trace collection, and performance counter capture.

Usage:
    python3 run-ttnn-profiler.py --command "<test_command>" \
        --report-name <name> --output-dir <dir> [options]

Examples:
    # Basic profiling only
    python3 run-ttnn-profiler.py \
        --command "test_ttnn_functional_vit.py" \
        --report-name vit_test \
        --output-dir ./profiler_output \
        --basic-only

    # Full profiling (raw + NOC traces + perf counters)
    python3 run-ttnn-profiler.py \
        --command "test_ttnn_functional_vit.py" \
        --report-name vit_full \
        --output-dir ./profiler_output

    # Pytest mode with cleanup
    python3 run-ttnn-profiler.py \
        --command "tests/ttnn/unit_tests/test_model.py::test_forward" \
        --pytest \
        --report-name model_test \
        --output-dir ./profiler_output \
        --cleanup

    # Dry run to see commands without executing
    python3 run-ttnn-profiler.py \
        --command "test.py" \
        --report-name test \
        --output-dir ./out \
        --dryrun

Required Arguments:
    --command       Test script or command to run under the profiler
    --report-name   Name for the profiling report
    --output-dir    Directory to save profiler outputs (must not exist)

Optional Arguments:
    --pytest            Run command with pytest (-m pytest prefix)
    --basic-only        Skip NOC traces and performance counter collection
    --op-support-count  Maximum number of ops tracy will profile (default: 100000)
    --disable-logging   Disable TTNN logging (enable_logging=False in config overrides)
                        Some workloads like VGG have device synchronize calls that
                        fail when enable_logging is true. Use this flag for such cases.
    --show-output       Show stdout/stderr in real-time during command execution.
                        Useful for monitoring progress and debugging hanging commands.
                        By default, output is only captured and saved to results file.
    --cleanup           Remove npe_viz and .logs directories after profiling.
                        These generated directories can be very large; use this flag
                        if their contents are not needed for analysis.
    --dryrun, -n        Show commands without executing them
    --skip-fail-check   Skip the no-tracy pre-flight run (go straight to the Tracy passes).
                        By default a fast pre-flight runs the command once WITHOUT tracy and
                        aborts before the expensive Tracy passes if it fails.
    --fail-check-only   Run ONLY the no-tracy pre-flight, then stop (no Tracy passes, no merge).
                        Exits non-zero if the command fails. Use to validate a command before
                        committing to a full capture. Mutually exclusive with --skip-fail-check.
                        The output dir gets a '--failcheckonly' suffix so it can't collide with
                        or be mistaken for a full capture written to the same --output-dir.
    --disable-dram-drop-guard  Disable the DRAM-drop guard (on by default). Normally, if the
                        profiler DRAM-buffer-overflow marker appears too frequently (capture likely
                        incomplete), the command is given a grace period and then force-stopped.

Output Structure:
    <output-dir>/

        │                                  # streamed live + flushed per line so a Ctrl-C on a hang
        │                                  # keeps it; stderr lines tagged "[stderr]"
        ├── run_status.json        # Live run-status sidecar: overall + per-step state (machine-readable)
        ├── STATUS.txt             # Same, rendered as a human table (watch/cat it during a run)
        ├── merged_ops_<RUNID>.csv  # 3-CSV merge (full mode only; RUNID = output-dir name)
        ├── failcheck/              # No-tracy pre-flight artifacts (unless --skip-fail-check)
        ├── raw/                    # Tracy raw profiling output (.logs/, reports/, generated/)
        ├── perf/                   # Tracy performance counter output (full mode only)
        └── trace/                  # Tracy NOC trace output (full mode only)

    Each pass dir is self-contained: TT_METAL_LOGS_PATH and TT_METAL_PROFILER_DIR
    are pinned to it (see run_profiler), so the bulk of tt-metal's 'generated/' output
    lands under the pass dir rather than the cwd. A few paths don't honor those env
    vars (e.g. generated/fabric, generated/test_reports) and may still appear in the
    cwd — small, idempotent, low collision risk (see presets/README.md). This lets two
    runs execute concurrently from the same (e.g. shared/NFS) tt-metal checkout.

Prerequisites:
    - NPE tools must be on PATH (source tt-npe/ENV_SETUP)
    - Tracy profiler module must be available
    - loguru package must be installed

Notes:
    - Before the profiling passes, a fast no-tracy pre-flight runs the command once (unless
      --skip-fail-check) so a trivially-broken command (import error, bad -k selector, arg
      error) fails fast instead of wasting the expensive Tracy capture. With --fail-check-only
      the script runs just that pre-flight and stops (no Tracy passes, no merge).
    - The script then runs up to 3 profiling passes:
      1. Raw profiling with TTNN config overrides
      2. Performance counter collection (unless --basic-only)
      3. NOC trace collection (unless --basic-only)
    - Execution stops if the pre-flight or any pass fails
    - DRAM-drop guard (on by default; --disable-dram-drop-guard turns it off): if the profiler
      DRAM-buffer-overflow marker ("Profiler DRAM buffers were full, markers were dropped!") is
      seen too frequently, the command is given a grace period to finish and then force-stopped,
      since its capture is almost certainly incomplete. With the guard off, the marker is still
      counted and the run-status step flagged dram_drop_tripped (a rc-0 pass is not silently trusted).
    - A live status sidecar (run_status.json + STATUS.txt) is written to the output dir, updated on
      every step transition and on a ~2s heartbeat, so `watch cat <dir>/STATUS.txt` shows overall +
      per-step progress (including stalls via last-output age, interrupts, and force-stops).
    - All tt-metal artifacts land directly under each pass dir (no cwd/generated);
      concurrent runs from one directory therefore do not collide
    - After a successful full run (raw+perf+trace), the three CSVs are merged into
      merged_ops_<RUNID>.csv on this node, so only it (+ hw_id.json, run_status.json, STATUS.txt)
      need be copied off the board. The per-board DRAM peak BW is resolved from an internal interim table
      keyed on tt-smi board_type (interim/placeholder values pending the DRAM-BW
      review). Skipped for --basic-only or when the board can't be resolved.

    When ``log_path`` is set, each output line is written to the file and flushed AS IT ARRIVES
    (independent of ``show_output``), and the file is finalized in a ``finally`` block. So if the
    command hangs and is Ctrl-C'd, the output produced up to that point is already on disk rather
    than lost with the un-returned in-memory buffer. stdout is written verbatim; stderr lines are
    tagged with a "[stderr] " prefix; the two streams are interleaved in arrival order (a true
    typescript). On SIGINT the child is terminated and the run reported as returncode 130.
